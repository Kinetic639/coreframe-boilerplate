## Next Steps

1. **Migrate Locations Service** (highest priority for inventory management)
2. **Migrate Stock Movements Service** (core transaction system)
3. **Update Products Components** to use new hooks
4. **Test Products CRUD** operations end-to-end
5. **Continue with remaining warehouse services**

---

## Notes & Decisions

1. **Type Imports:** Using relative path `../../../supabase/types/types` instead of `@/supabase/types/types` due to tsconfig path mapping pointing to `src/utils/supabase/*`

2. **User Context:** Currently using placeholder values for `userRole` and `permissions` in `getUserContext()`. These will be fetched from database when needed for authorization.

3. **AppContext Refactoring:** Per review feedback, AppContext cleanup (removing business data like locations, suppliers, organizationUsers) is deferred to backlog (Issue #76) until after main migration is complete.

4. **Migration Strategy:** Big bang per module (not gradual) - each module is fully migrated before moving to the next.

5. **Service Pattern:** All services use static methods for simplicity. No service instances needed.

---

## Success Metrics (To Be Measured)

- **Code Reduction:** Target 95% duplication eliminated
- **Type Safety:** 100% end-to-end
- **SSR:** All pages server-rendered
- **Developer Speed:** <15 min per new endpoint
- **Bug Reduction:** 50% fewer auth/validation bugs

**Key Learning:**

- Fixed TypeScript discriminated union errors by **removing explicit return type annotations** from server actions (following Sales Orders pattern)
- TypeScript's control flow analysis works better with inferred types than explicit union types
- Pattern: `if (!result.success) throw new Error(result.error);` followed by `return result.data;`
